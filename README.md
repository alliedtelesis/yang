# YANG Data Models

This repository contains **YANG data models** for managing and configuring networking equipment developed by **Allied Telesis**. These models are used in conjunction with standards-based protocols such as **NETCONF** and **RESTCONF** for programmatic interaction with network devices.

## Repository Overview

The repository is structured to organize and version **YANG** models efficiently:

    /yang
        /models - All data models in filename@revision format


## What is YANG?

**YANG** (Yet Another Next Generation) is a data modeling language used to describe:
- Configuration data
- State data
- RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls)
- Notifications

YANG models ensure that network elements' data is represented in a consistent, standardized manner for automation, validation, and communication.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:
1. A central location for storing **YANG** models for Allied Telesis networking products.
2. A versioned reference for customers and internal developers to integrate the models with **NETCONF** or **RESTCONF** clients.

## License

This repository is subject to Allied Telesis licensing policies. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution is prohibited.

Happy automating with YANG!
